# 🧪 Past Contributions (Test Repo)

This repository is created for **testing purposes only**.

The goal is to simulate backdated commits across the past year in order to:

- Check how GitHub’s contribution graph behaves.
- Verify that my GitHub profile's `snake.svg` contribution animation works as expected.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is **not representative of actual work**. All commits are artificial and generated using a Python script to test contribution visualizations.

You can find the snake animation here:
